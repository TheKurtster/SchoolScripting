# Linux Shell Scripts

Under here you will find all of my Linux Shell Scripts.
In Level 2 Linux we learned the inner workings of the operating system.
Most scripts were written to show the completion of our work.


In Level 3 Linux we are learning about different services.
Most scripts are written to display helpful information to the SysAdmin (myself).
Order and function of the script does not matter, as long as it is the correct output.
